MLlib is Sparkâ€™s machine learning (ML) library. Its goal is to make practical machine learning scalable and easy. At a high level, it provides tools such as:

* ML Algorithms: common learning algorithms such as classification, regression, clustering, and collaborative filtering
* Featurization: feature extraction, transformation, dimensionality reduction, and selection
* Pipelines: tools for constructing, evaluating, and tuning ML Pipelines
* Persistence: saving and load algorithms, models, and Pipelines
* Utilities: linear algebra, statistics, data handling, etc.
